.. py:class:: Family

   Bases: :py:obj:`pywikibot.family.Family`

   Parent singleton class for all wiki families.

   .. py:method:: scriptpath(self, code)

      The prefix used to locate scripts on this wiki.

      This is the value displayed when you enter {{SCRIPTPATH}} on a
      wiki page (often displayed at [[Help:Variables]] if the wiki has
      copied the master help page correctly).

      The default value is the one used on Wikimedia Foundation wikis,
      but needs to be overridden in the family file for any wiki that
      uses a different value.

      :param code: Site code
      :raises KeyError: code is not recognised
      :return: URL path without ending '/'


   .. py:method:: protocol(self, code)

      The protocol to use to connect to the site.

      May be overridden to return 'https'. Other protocols are not supported.

      :param code: language code
      :return: protocol that this family uses
