   *Jesus came and told his disciples, 
   "I have been given all authority in heaven and on earth.
   Therefore, go and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing
   them in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit.
   Teach these new disciples to obey all the commands I have given you.
   And be sure of this: I am with you always, even to the end of the age."*

   *Matthew 28:18-20*
