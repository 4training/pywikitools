# Contributing

We're very happy about every contribution! :smile:
You can contribute in many ways:

## Types of Contributions

### Implement Features

Look through the GitHub issues: If there is nobody assigned for an issue, it is
open to whoever wants to implement it.

### Write Documentation

Python Mediawiki Tools could always use more documentation, weather as part of
the official Python Mediawiki Tools docs, in docstrings, or even on the web in
blog posts, articles, and such.

### Submit Feedback

The best way to send feedback is to file an issue
at [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/4training/pywikitools/issues).

If you are proposing a feature:

* Explain in detail how it would work.
* Keep the scope as narrow as possible, to make it easier to implement.
* Remember that this is a volunteer-driven project, and that contributions are
  welcome :smile:

## Get Started!

Ready to contribute? Here's how to set up `pywikitools` for local development.

1. Fork the `pywikitools` repo on GitHub.
2. Clone your fork locally:

   ```shell
   $ git clone git@github.com:your_name_here/pywikitools.git
   ```

3. Follow the setup instructions in README.md
4. Create a branch for local development:

   ```shell
   $ git checkout -b name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature
   ```

   Now you can make your changes locally.

5. When you're done making changes, check that all tests are passing and that
   `flake8` has nothing to complain:

   ```shell
   $ python3 -m unittest discover -s pywikitools/test
   $ flake8 .
   ```

6. Commit your changes and push your branch to GitHub:

   ```shell
   $ git add .
   $ git commit -m "Your meaningful description of your changes."
   $ git push origin name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature
   ```

7. Submit a pull request through the GitHub website.

## Coding conventions

* Please write good and readable code with meaningful documentation.
* We do our best to follow the PEP 8 style guide ([PEP 8](https://pep8.org/))
  with the exception that lines can have up to `120 characters`.
* Every script should print documentation on arguments when run without or with
  incorrect arguments.

### Logging

Every script should implement good logging (
see [Python Logging](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/logging.html)). Look at
`translateodt.py` for examples. Details:

* Create a named logger object (and only use this object for logging)

  ```python
  logger = logging.getLogger('pywikitools.scriptname')
  ```

* Implement `-l / --loglevel` argument.
* Standard log level is `WARNING`. `INFO` adds relevant information. `DEBUG` is
  for verbose debugging.
* `ERROR` means the script couldnâ€™t finish as expected.

## Pull Request Guidelines

Before you submit a pull request, check that it meets these guidelines:

1. The pull request should include tests.
2. If the pull request adds functionality, the docs should be updated.
   The minimum is to make sure functions have correct docstrings.
3. Write meaningful commit messages.

## Tips

To run a subset of tests:

```shell
$ python3 pywikitools/test/test_script.py
```
