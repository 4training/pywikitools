"""
This module contains core classes for the correcting functionality:
- LanguageCorrector as the base class for all language-specific corrector classes
- UniversalCorrector containing rules that can be applied in all languages
- Corrector classes for groups of languages

Every language-specific corrector inherits from multiple classes:
- LanguageCorrector for the core functionality (invoking the correction and gathering statistics)
- UniversalCorrector and more classes (for groups of languages) with correction functions

By using multiple inheritance we can add correction functionality in an easy and flexible way.
The calling of corrector functions is done by introspection following these naming conventions:
Functions starting with "correct_": applied to every translation unit
Functions ending with "_title": applied only to the title translation unit
Functions ending with "_filename": applied only to translation units containing a file name

Caution: functions in a language-specific corrector must never have the same names as
one of the functions here (otherwise only one of it gets called in the case of multiple inheritance)

Each function should have a documentation string which will be used for print_stats()

Implementation notes:
The alternative to using introspection would be to register the correction functions
introduced by each class during initialization. That would be more explicit but
it gets a bit tricky with multiple inheritance and making sure that __init__() of
each base class gets called
